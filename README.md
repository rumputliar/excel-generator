# Excel Random Name and Support Ticket Update Generators

In order to create a dashboard design that analyses the performance of customer support/service agents, I first needed to generate a fictional and randomised dataset for it.

The result are two Excel files:

1. Random business and people's name generator
* https://github.com/datamesse/excel-support-ticket-update-generator/blob/main/Random_name_and_business_generator.xlsx

2. Random support ticket update generator
* https://github.com/datamesse/excel-support-ticket-update-generator/blob/main/Support_ticket_updates_generator_v2.xlsx

A sample file of the output can be found here
* https://github.com/datamesse/excel-support-ticket-update-generator/blob/main/Support_ticket_updates_v2.xlsx

You can find details on how these generators work in this blog post:

A third Excel file has a dataset extracted from Wikipedia with relative data points on when Daylight Savings gets applied for different timezones and the hour offsets, which I've referred to as anchors.

3. Standard and Daylight Saving Observations dataset
* https://github.com/datamesse/excel-support-ticket-update-generator/blob/main/Time_zone_offsets_and_DST_observations.xlsx

You can find details on how this dataset was created from Powr BI in this blog post:
