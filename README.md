# Excel Random Name and Support Ticket Update Generators

In order to create a dashboard design that analyses the performance of customer support/service agents, I first needed to generate a fictional and randomised dataset for it.

The result are two Excel files:

1. Random business and people's name generator

2. Random support ticket update generator
* https://github.com/datamesse/excel-support-ticket-update-generator/blob/main/Support_ticket_updates_generator_v2.xlsx

A sample file of the output can be found here

You can find details on how these generators work in the following blog post:
